      <description>On October 5, 2022, the DOJ&amp;rsquo;s Civil Division &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23126616-2022-10-05-145-foi-18864-acknowledgment-letter&#34;&gt;emailed an acknowledgment letter ðŸ“„&lt;/a&gt; regarding this request, which has been assigned to the &amp;ldquo;complex&amp;rdquo; processing track. &amp;ldquo;The records you seek require a search in another Office in the Division; therefore, your request presents &amp;lsquo;unusual circumstances&amp;rsquo; under the FOIA,&amp;rdquo; according to the letter. The agency has agreed to classify the Data Liberation Project as a &amp;ldquo;representative of the news media,&amp;rdquo; which means the request will not incur search fees. It has not, however, &amp;ldquo;yet made a decision on your request for a [full] fee waiver.&amp;rdquo;</description>
