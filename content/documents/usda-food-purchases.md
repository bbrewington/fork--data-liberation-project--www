---

In November 2022, the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) sent the Department of Agriculture [a request](/requests/usda-food-purchases/) for data from â€” and documentation of â€” the agency's Web Based Supply Chain Management System (`WBSCM`), which it uses for coordinating the purchase and distribution of federal food and commodity orders.

In conversations with the Data Liberation Project, the agency said it was unable to export the data records requested; the Data Liberation Project agreed to re-focus the request on the documentation records. The agency [initially refused to provide those records](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23941261-2023-09-01-2023-ams-00030-f-final-response-letter), citing FOIA exemptions 3 and 7(E). After the Data Liberation Project [appealed this decision](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24178295-2023-11-28-appeal-re-ams-foia-request-2023-ams-00030-f) (with the assistance of the Cornell Law School First Amendment Clinic), the USDA has begun to provide the records.
