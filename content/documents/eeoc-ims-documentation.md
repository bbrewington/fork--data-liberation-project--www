On November 29, 2022, the Data Liberation Project [filed a FOIA request](../requests/eeoc-ims-documentation/) to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, seeking documentation of its Integrated Mission System.

On February 23, 2023, the EEOC provided the "[first interim production](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23689387-2023-02-23-20230223_firstinterimlod-820-2023-002324)" of records responsive to this request. It consists of [one PDF](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23689388-2023-02-23-820-2023-002324-interim-1-responsive-documents), which appears to be an entity relationship diagram listing database tables, column names, and the relationships between them.

On October 31, 2023, the EEOC provided a "[second interim production](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24116559-2023-10-31-20231030_interim2lod-820-2023-002324)" of records responsive to this request. It consists of [one 650-page PDF](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24116560-2023-10-31-820-2023-002324-interim-2-responsive-documents) that appears be an Oracle database schema for EEOC's IMS database; it lists the names, columns, and column constraints of 600+ tables. Based on the table names referenced, it seems to describe a different database system than the records provided in the first interim production.

As the EEOC provides additional records, the Data Liberation Project will share them here.
