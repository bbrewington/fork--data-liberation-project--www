*This request is a collaboration with [Maddy Varner](https://maddy.zone/) of [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/).*

In November 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [announced](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-comprehensive-strategy-enhance-hospital-capacity-amid-covid-19-surge) a new waiver program, called Acute Hospital Care At Home (AHCaH), aimed at ‚Äúproviding eligible hospitals with unprecedented regulatory flexibilities to treat eligible patients in their homes.‚Äù

The [waiver](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=202209-0938-005), ‚Äúwhich is granted at the individual hospital/CMS Certification Number (CCN) level, waives ¬ß482.23(b) and (b)(1) of the Hospital Conditions of Participation (CoPs) which require nursing services to be provided on premises 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the immediate availability of a registered nurse for care of any patient.‚Äù

Hospitals approved for an AHCaH waiver must submit weekly or monthly ‚Äú[reporting measures](https://web.archive.org/web/20230124174838/https://qualitynet.cms.gov/acute-hospital-care-at-home/measures),‚Äù monitoring information crucial to assessing the hospital‚Äôs performance with regards to the waiver ‚Äî including patient volume, "unanticipated mortality" counts, "escalation" rates, a question relating the hospital's safety committee, and a patient list.

[Our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23588872-2023-01-27-hhscms-acute-hospital-care-at-home-foia-request-singer-vinevarner) seeks all database records pertaining to AHCaH waiver requests, their processing by CMS, and the reporting measures submitted by participating hospitals, with the exception of personally-identifiable information. It also seeks all relevant database documentation.
