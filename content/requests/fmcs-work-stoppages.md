    On February 9, 2023, FMCS‚Äôs FOIA office [responded](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23622117-2023-02-09-foia-partial-grant) with a ‚Äúpartial grant,‚Äù providing the Data Liberation Project with just one documentation file, and withholding all other records. ‚ÄúThere are 733 pages of records fully redacted under FOIA Exemption 4 and 6,‚Äù according the agency‚Äôs letter. In the meantime, we‚Äôve [uploaded the one file](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/fmcs-work-stoppage-records) the agency did provide: An Excel spreadsheet named ‚ÄúProd Schema.xlsx‚Äù. (The Data Liberation Project intended to appeal the decision, but ultimately missed the deadline to do so.)

    On January 25, 2023, FMCS emailed [a letter üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23586874-2023-01-25-foia-extension-letter) "notifying you of an extension of our time to respond by 10 business days due to the following reason as provided by 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552(a)(6)(B)(i): The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request."

*Note: This request was inspired by a [similar request by Forest Gregg](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/work-stoppage-date-from-january-2021-through-august-2021-119149/), which FMCS denied for reasons that the Data Liberation Project believes were weakly supported.*

The [Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service](https://www.fmcs.gov/) (FMCS) is an independent federal agency that helps to mediate labor-management disputes. As part of those efforts, it tracks work stoppages (strikes and lockouts) through its case management system. 

For many years, FMCS proactively [published data](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105232710/https://www.fmcs.gov/resources/documents-and-data/#fusion-tab-workstoppagedata) on the general characteristics of individual work stoppages. Those records included the following information for each ongoing and recently ended stoppage:

- Employer
- Union
- Union Local
- Case Number
- BU (‚Äúnumber of workers in the Bargaining Unit‚Äù)
- NAICS
- Industry
- City, State
- \# Idled
- Start Date
- End Date
- Duration

FMCS, however, appears to have ended this practice of proactive disclosure in late 2020. The section of the FMCS‚Äôs website that originally hosted the data has been removed, and the files do not appear to be available elsewhere, other than through archiving websites.

FMCS is unlikely to have stopped collecting this information. It is central to FMCS‚Äôs core mission and, moreover, FMCS appears to have continued supplying such information to the Bureau of Labor Statics, which republishes a subset of it online through the BLS‚Äôs [Work Stoppages Program](https://www.bls.gov/wsp/).

That program, however, publishes data only on the largest work stoppages, those involving 1,000 or more workers. To members of the public that ask, ‚ÄúWhere do I find data on work stoppages with less than 1,000 workers?‚Äù [BLS responds](https://www.bls.gov/wsp/questions-and-answers.htm), ‚ÄúThe Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) issues a monthly report showing all private industry work stoppages.‚Äù

[Our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23557284-2022-12-26-fmcs-work-stoppages-fmcs-0004-documentation-foia-request-singer-vine) to FMCS seeks database records describing the general characteristics of all FMCS-tracked work stoppages, plus all documentation of [FMCS-0004](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/16/2022-05544/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records), the system of records that appears to contain the records.
