    On January 24, 2023, the Department of the Interior emailed [an acknowledgment letter 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23586464-2023-01-24-23-001589-ack). It has assigned the request to its "complex" processing track and classified the DLP as a representative of the news media. Additionally: "Because of your entitlements, we do not anticipate there will be billable fees for processing your request, so there is no need for us to address your request for a fee waiver."

    On July 17, 2023, the Department of the Interior emailed [a final response letter 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23886724-2023-07-17-23-001589_final-response). "After a thorough search, it has been determined that Office of the Secretary has no records responsive to you request. The Office of Chief Information Office informed our office that they did not discover any additional data inventories beyond those that are harvested by the current data inventory at data.doi.gov which are reported to data.gov. The program office then queried other bureaus within the Department of the Interior to check if their offices are using other data asset inventories." According to a [document provided alongside the determination 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23886725-2023-07-17-doi-data-inventory-attestation), those bureaus each attested that they held no further data inventories.

[44 U.S. Code § 3511(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3511) mandates that “the head of each agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, develop and maintain a __comprehensive data inventory__ that accounts for all data assets created by, collected by, under the control or direction of, or maintained by the agency.” These comprehensive data inventories have specific requirements, are distinct from “data catalogs,” and are not restricted to public datasets.

Another portion of federal law, [44 U.S. Code § 3505(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3505), requires that “[t]he head of each agency shall develop and maintain an __inventory of major information systems__ (including major national security systems) operated by or under the control of such agency.”

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23560279-2022-12-29-doi-data-inventories-foia-request-singer-vine) to the Department of the Interior (DOI) seeks all records that contribute to the agency's fulfillment of those two requirements.

Notably, the DOI’s Chief Data Officer [led a federal working group](https://web.archive.org/web/20220328094444/https://www.cdo.gov/data-inventory/) in the production of an [April 2022 report underscoring the importance of agency data inventories](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/CDOC_Data_Inventory_Report_Final.pdf).

The agency does publish a listing of datasets via [https://data.doi.gov/data.json](https://web.archive.org/web/20221220163807/https://data.doi.gov/data.json), that file appears to be substantially incomplete. For instance: Only 57 entries reference non-public datasets, all maintained by the National Park Service (and none by other subagencies); only five entries reference datasets maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and only one by the Bureau of Reclamation, both numbers being far below the realistic number of datasets those subagencies maintain.
