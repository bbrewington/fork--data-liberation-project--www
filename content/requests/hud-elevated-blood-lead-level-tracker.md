[Lead-based paint](https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-sources-lead) poses [substantial health risks](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead) to residents of homes these hazards have not been remediated. The federal government banned the residential use of lead-based paint, but more than 100,000 of today's public housing buildings were constructed before that year, according to a [recent Development of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Inspector General report](https://www.hudoig.gov/reports-publications/report/risk-indicators-lead-based-paint-hazards-public-housing-agencies).

A [June 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-394) identified two key internal databases that HUD has used to track lead-related risks and remediation. In November 2022, the Data Liberation Project [filed a FOIA request]({{< ref lead-based-paint-response-tracker.md >}}) for the first component, a database it calls the Lead-Based Paint Response Tracker.

Now we're seeking the second component, the Elevated Blood Lead Level Tracker, which the GAO report says HUD "uses to collect and monitor information reported by PHAs on cases of elevated blood levels in children living in voucher and public housing units."

[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23587395-2023-01-26-hud-elevated-blood-lead-level-tracker-foia-request-singer-vine) asks for a full copy of the Elevated Blood Lead Level Tracker and all relevant database documentation.
