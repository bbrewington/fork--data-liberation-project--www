A [2017 report from the Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-17-114) indicates that the Department of Defense and Army maintain records about the numbers, locations, and revenues of slot machines on overseas military installations. According to data the DOD provided to the GAO, "in fiscal years 2011 through 2015, DOD-run slot machines generated a total of $538.9 million in revenue." The Army accounted for roughly half of that revenue. 

Very few details, however, are publicly available regarding the operation of those slot machines.

[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24662028-2024-05-14-army-slot-machine-foia-request-singer-vinelongman) to the Army sought all records â€” spreadsheets, databases, reports, presentations, and/or memoranda â€” indicating the number, location, sponsors of, and/or revenue of slot machines on DOD properties.
