The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains two key databases related to fair housing complaints:

- The Form 903 Admin tool, named after the agency's [main fair housing complaint form](https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/DOC_12150.PDF), which can be submitted [online](https://portalapps.hud.gov/FHEO903/Form903/Form903Start.action) and through other means.

- The [HUD Enforcement Management System](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/system/hems) (`HEMS`), "the system where case data on housing discrimination complaint inquiries and case files are documented during the investigation process." 

[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24655569-2024-05-08-hems-and-form-903-admin-data-records-foia-request-uberoysinger-vine) seeks complaint- and case-level records (minus personally-identifying information) maintained in these databases since 2010.
