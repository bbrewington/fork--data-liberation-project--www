The [Automated Targeting System](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/automated-targeting-system-ats-update) is a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) "decision support tool that compares traveler, cargo, and conveyance information against law enforcement, intelligence, and other enforcement data using risk-based scenarios and assessments." It stores a wide range of records on people and cargo, collected directly as well as copied from other government data systems. (For more details, see CBP's 2017 [Privacy Impact Assessment update](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-07/privacy-pia-cbp006-ats-july2022_0.pdf).)

Among those records are data that CBP extracts from individuals' electronic devices â€”Â the subject of a [recent letter from Sen. Ron Wyden to the agency](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-reveals-new-details-about-us-customs-and-border-protections-egregious-violations-of-americans-rights-during-warrantless-electronic-device-searches), as well as [coverage in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/15/government-surveillance-database-dhs/).

[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23258078-2022-10-31-dhscbp-ats-documentation-foia-request) seeks all records that *document* the ATS, such as database diagrams and user guides. Such records are essential to (a) providing the public with a clearer and more specific understanding of the types of information DHS/CBP may hold about them, and (b) enabling the public to construct productive, efficient FOIA requests for particular slices of non-exempt database material in the future.
