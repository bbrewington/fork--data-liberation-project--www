*This request is a collaboration with journalist [Molly Longman](https://www.molly-longman.com/).*


The USDA's [National Organics Program](https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program) ‚Äúlaunched the COMPLIANCE Database in March 2019," according to the department's [*Organic Oversight and Enforcement Update Summary of Activities*](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOPEnforcementUpdateMay2019.pdf) a couple of months later. "This new tool allows the team to better track case progress and more quickly identify patterns and relationships across complaints.‚Äù

According to a [subsequent report](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOPEnforcementReport2022.pdf), the system received 850 "complaints and the inquiries" in fiscal year 2021; of those, the agency deemed it necessary to investigate 58%. (The other 42% were "actually simple questions about an operation or the organic regulations, which can be resolved quickly with educational information.")

[Our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24229172-2023-12-18-ams-nop-compliance-database-foia-request-singer-vinelongman) seeks a comprehensive set of complaint, investigation, and outcome records from this database, as well as documentation concerning the database's structure and interpretation.
