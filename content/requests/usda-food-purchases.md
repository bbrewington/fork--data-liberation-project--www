As part of its work supporting the [National School Lunch Program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp), [Commodity Supplemental Food Program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/csfp/commodity-supplemental-food-program), and other major nutrition food programs, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) purchases large amounts of food and food commodities. It tracks these purchases through its [Web Based Supply Chain Management](https://www.usda.gov/topics/food-and-nutrition/web-based-supply-chain-management) system (`WBSCM`).

"On a yearly basis, `WBSCM` directly supports the order, procurement, and delivery of over 6.5 billion pounds of American farm food commodities with a value in excess of $4 billion," according to the agency.

A [recent Government Accountability Office report](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105179) demonstrates the public interest of `WBSCM` data, which the authors analyzed to assess USDA's efficacy providing seafood to students through the National School Lunch Program.

[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23329268-2022-11-30-usdaams-wbscm-foia-request-singer-vine) to USDA seeks all database records stored within `WBSCM`, plus all relevant database documentation.
