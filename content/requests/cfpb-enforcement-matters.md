  title: Additional Records Discovered And Withheld
  body: >-
    On June 26, 2024, CFPB emailed a [letter üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25038495-2024-06-26-cfpb-2023-0365-rem-determination-letter) denying access to additional records uncovered via the appeal-remanded search. It reads, in part: "A search of our Office of Enforcement identified records responsive to your May 30, 2023 request that were omitted from our September 18, 2023 response. However, these omitted records are withheld in full pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 552(b)(7)(E). Additionally, due to the way the requested information is stored, it would create an undue burden on the CFPB to determine the amount of reasonably segregable data beyond what was previously released."

  title: Appeal Partly Granted
  body: >-
    On December 18, 2023, CFPB's legal department [provided a determination letter üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24229211-2023-12-18-final-appellate-determination-letter_2023-0365-a) in response to the Data Liberation Project's November 16 appeal. The determination grants the appeal of CFPB's handling of the data portion of the request: "Here, the FOIA Office appears to have determined it was releasing segregable portions of the requested records in response to the Request. Nonetheless, the FOIA Office did not indicate the amount of information deleted or explain the exemption under which the deletion was made. I therefore grant your appeal with respect to Part 1 of the Request and remand the Request to the FOIA Office to determine whether any additional reasonably segregable non-exempt records can be produced without the agency expending an unreasonable amount of time and resources, and to release any reasonably segregable non-exempt records that are not subject to any exemption." The letter, however, denied the appeal for the second portion of the request, which sought training materials related to the database.

One of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau‚Äôs key roles is to [investigate and enforce](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/life-cycle-of-enforcement-action/) potential violations of federal consumer finance laws. To track and organize those efforts, the CFPB uses an ‚Äúenforcement matter management system‚Äù called `ENForce`.

In response to a [prior FOIA request](../cfpb-enforcement-database-documentation/), the Data Liberation Project received [documentation describing some of the structure of the `ENForce` database](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23777876-2023-04-14-cfpb-2023-0206-f-binder).

Based on that documentation, [*this* FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23831884-2023-05-30-cfpb-enforce-database-records-foia-request-singer-vine) seeks all records in the following database tables *for matters that have either reached a final disposition or public action* (i.e., excluding ongoing, nonpublic matters):

- Matter
- Case
- Associated Entities
- Entity
- Matter IPL Link
- Institutional Product Line, IPL
- Financial Product
- Statutes
- Claims
- Public Action
- Final Disposition
- Monetary Relief & Penalties
- Final Order
- Order Provision
- Defendant Compliance
- Defendant
- PEA Named Parties
- Named Parties

... excluding columns containing records of a personally sensitive nature or that would have to be individually inspected for redaction.
