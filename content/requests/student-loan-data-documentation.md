The Department of Education recently published "[system of records notices](https://www2.ed.gov/notices/ed-pia.html)" relating to four key databases that track information about student loans:

- [National Student Loan Data System (`NSLDS`)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/22/2022-20682/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records)
- [Common Origination and Disbursement (`COD`) System](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/13/2022-19888/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records)
- [Common Services for Borrowers (`CSB`)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/13/2022-19887/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records)
- [Enterprise Data Management and Analytics Platform Services (`EDMAPS`)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/13/2022-19886/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records)

[Our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22925203-2022-09-23-edfsa-nsldsedmapscsbcod-documentation-foia-request) seeks all records that *document* these systems, such as database diagrams and user guides. This differs from the other requests in our initial batch of FOIAs, which also seek the database contents themselves. Ultimately, we'd like to file requests for specific student loan data, but these systems are so sprawling that at first we're just seeking to better understand what's possible.

We also hope that these documents will shed light on important technical aspects of how the government undertakes its student loan operations and oversight.
