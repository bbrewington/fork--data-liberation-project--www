*This request is a collaboration with [Aaron Gordon](https://aaronwgordon.com/) of [Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en/contributor/aaron-gordon).*

[Our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23820664-2023-05-22-usps-forms-4241-a-4003-data-foia-request-singer-vinegordon) to USPS seeks two related sets of database records:

- Database records corresponding to all __PS Form 4241-A__ (‚ÄúRural Route Evaluation‚Äù) outputs generated, excluding employee names and employee IDs. Per a [2012 guide](https://knowledgebase.ruralinfo.net/shared-files/120/?Guide-for-the-PS-Form-4241A.pdf) compiled by the National Rural Letter Carriers‚Äô Association (NRLCA), ‚ÄúThe USPS Integrated Business Solutions Services Center (IBSSC) prints and issues PS Form 4241-A to carriers on rural routes as a result of national counts, special counts, or a change in route data initiated by the submission of PS Form 4003, Official Rural Route Description.‚Äù

- Database records corresponding to all __PS Form 4003__ ("Official Rural Route Description") submissions. Per the [same guide cited above](https://knowledgebase.ruralinfo.net/shared-files/120/?Guide-for-the-PS-Form-4241A.pdf), this form "is utilized to submit changes to route data for reasons other than changes resulting from a mail count.‚Äù It ‚Äúis submitted to adjust a route evaluation based upon changes to active boxes (centralized and regular), stops, weekly dismounts, weekly dismount distance, lock pouch allowances, extension (temporary route deviations for more than 30 days), official route re-measurements, amended counts, new routes created, adjustments for seasonal routes, the assignment of a government vehicle, etc.‚Äù

Our request also seeks all relevant database documentation.

We've submitted this request in the context of USPS [rolling out the Rural Route Evaluated Compensation System](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88xnbb/two-thirds-of-rural-mail-carriers-are-being-hit-with-a-massive-pay-cut-calculated-by-an-algorithm)  (RRECS), which the NRLCA says would result in pay cuts for two-thirds of rural mail routes reevaluated by the system.

Rural mail carriers [have reported](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/pay/2023/04/usps-delays-rollout-of-new-pay-system-after-data-shows-pay-cuts-for-rural-carriers/) confusion and frustration with the changes, and allege it contains substantial errors, yet USPS has shared little information publicly that would allow independent observers to evaluate the changes introduced by the system, or to compare them to historical, pre-RRECS route compensation changes.
