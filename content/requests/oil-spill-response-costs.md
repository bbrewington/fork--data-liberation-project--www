When oil spills occur in the US and its waters, he US Coast Guardâ€™s [National Pollution Funds Center](https://www.uscg.mil/Mariners/National-Pollution-Funds-Center/About-NPFC/) (NPFC) "provides funding for quick response, compensates claimants for cleanup costs and damages, and takes action to recover costs from responsible parties."

[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23329271-2022-11-30-dhsuscgnpfc-spill-response-form-submissions-foia-request-singer-vine) to the Coast Guard seeks all records collected through three key sets of NPFC forms and workbooks:

- [Pollution Incident Report and Transmittal Forms](https://www.uscg.mil/Mariners/National-Pollution-Funds-Center/Response/Pollution-IRAT/) (IRAT), which [Federal On-Scene Coordinators](https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/epas-scene-coordinators-oscs) (FOSCs) submit "as the cover to the project's Final Financial Report, due within 120 days ofÂ completion of final removal actions." 
- [Pollution Incident Daily Resource Reports](https://www.uscg.mil/Mariners/National-Pollution-Funds-Center/Documentation-Cost/CG5136/) (CG 5136), which contractors must submit for costs incurred each day of the removal activity.
- [Pollution Removal Funding Authorization](https://www.uscg.mil/Mariners/National-Pollution-Funds-Center/Documentation-Cost/PRFAs/) (PRFA) Forms, "a tool available to FOSCs to quickly obtain needed services and assistance from other government agencies."

Our request also seeks documentation of the database systems holding these records.
