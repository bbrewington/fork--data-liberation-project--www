[Lead-based paint](https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-sources-lead) poses [substantial health risks](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead) to residents of homes these hazards have not been remediated. The federal government banned the residential use of lead-based paint, but more than 100,000 of today's public housing buildings were constructed before that year, according to a [recent Development of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Inspector General report](https://www.hudoig.gov/reports-publications/report/risk-indicators-lead-based-paint-hazards-public-housing-agencies).

In 2016, HUD launched an internal database it calls the Lead-Based Paint Response Tracker, which [another Office of Inspector General report](https://www.hudoig.gov/reports-publications/report/hud-lacked-adequate-oversight-public-housing-agencies-compliance-lead), the agency uses the database to “to track and monitor public housing agencies’ compliance with the Lead Safe Housing Rule”:

> staff inputs potentially noncompliant developments identified by [the Real Estate Assessment Center] into the response tracking system and then the regional or field office program staff would obtain, evaluate, and input supporting documentation such as, evidence of a lead-based paint inspection or support showing that the development was exempt, and comments into the response tracker.

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23329267-2022-11-29-hud-lead-based-paint-response-tracker-foia-request-singer-vine) to HUD seeks a full copy of the Lead-Based Paint Response Tracker, the documents it tracks, and all relevant database documentation.
