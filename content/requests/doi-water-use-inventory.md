  title: Acknowledgement of Clarified Request
  body: >-
    On March 29, 2023, following a March 27 conference call regarding this request, USGS emailed a ["Acknowledgement of Clarified Request" letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23736776-2023-03-29-23-3302-acknowledgement-of-clarification). The letter reflects the clarifications we made on the call — chiefly that we're seeking "[a]ll high-resolution water use data which contributed to the aggregated water use inventory," rather than the aggregated statistics already available online. The letter also notes that USGS has not yet made a determination on our request for a fee waiver," that "your request falls into the Extraordinary processing track, and that "[t]here are 40 requests pending ahead of yours in our overall processing queue."

*This request is a collaboration with [Maddy Varner](https://maddy.zone/) of [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/).*

[42 U.S. Code § 10368](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/10368), introduced by the Secure Water Act of 2009, requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish a "national water availability and use assessment program."

The law requires the program to include "the maintenance of a __comprehensive national water use inventory__ to enhance the level of understanding with respect to the effects of spatial and temporal patterns of water use on the availability and sustainable use of water resources[,]" as well as "the __integration of any dataset maintained by any other Federal or State agency__ into the dataset maintained by the Secretary[.]"

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23706311-2023-03-13-usgs-water-use-inventory-foia-request-singer-vinevarner) to the Department of the Interior (DOI) seeks a full copy of all database records corresponding to that inventory and those dataset integrations. It also seeks all relevant database documentation.

*Note: We sent [our initial FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23684733-2023-02-16-doi-water-use-inventory-foia-request-singer-vinevarner) (tracking number `DOI-OS-2023-002629`) to DOI's Office of the Secretary, which said it had no responsive records but suggested we resubmit to the US Geological Survey (USGS). See the updates section below for details.*
