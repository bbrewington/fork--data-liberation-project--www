The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau maintains a "system of records" titled "[CFPB.004â€”Enforcement Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/privacy/system-records-notices/enforcement-database/)," which enables the agency:

> to carry out its responsibilities with respect to enforcement of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other Federal consumer financial laws. This includes investigating potential violations of federal consumer financial laws, pursuing administrative or civil enforcement actions, and making appropriate referrals to other federal or state agencies.


[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23684835-2023-02-16-cfpb-enforcement-database-documentation-foia-request-singer-vine) seeks all records that *document* the Enforcement Database, such as database diagrams and user guides, for the purpose of better understanding the system and also to aid in the construction of efficient FOIA requests for particular slices of non-exempt database material in the future.
