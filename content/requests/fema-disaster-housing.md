The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides two main types of assistance to people affected by major disasters: financial assistance and "direct housing" assistance.

Receiving direct housing assistance means that FEMA acquires and provides a temporary place for you to live. The main options for direct housing are:

- Recreational Vehicles
- Manufactured Housing Units
- Multi-Family Lease and Repair
- Direct Lease
- Permanent Housing Construction

For more details about each option, see Table 1 of [FEMA's Direct Housing Guide](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/Direct_Housing_Guide_Feb2020.pdf) (February 2020). For further context, see the Congressional Research Service's [overview of FEMA's individual assistance programs](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46014/8).

FEMA tracks its direct housing operations through its __Housing Operations Management
Enterprise System (`HOMES`)__, which the [Direct Housing Guide](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/Direct_Housing_Guide_Feb2020.pdf) calls "the Direct Housing system of record." `HOMES` is a component of of FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (`NEMIS`), and specifically `NEMIS`'s "Individual Assistance" subsystem, `NEMIS-IA`.

The Data Liberation Project has been unable to locate public documentation concerning the specific structure of `HOMES` or a comprehensive accounting of the fields it contains. But the [Direct Housing Guide](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/Direct_Housing_Guide_Feb2020.pdf) describes some aspects of it. For instance, `HOMES` appears to track:

- Information about __applicants__ eligible for direct housing assistance, including a large amount of information that is personally-identifiable and potentially sensitive.
- The selection, inspection, and development of potential __sites__ for direct housing.
- The __progress__ installing temporary housing units, and preparing them for occupancy.
- Occupant __move-in and move-out__ dates.

To our knowledge, vanishingly little data from `HOMES` is available to the public.

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22925200-2022-09-23-dhsfema-homes-foia-request) to FEMA seeks all database records stored in `HOMES` (excluding data fields containing personally identifying information), plus all relevant database documentation.

The release of this data would shed invaluable light on a core component of FEMA's response to major disasters, which journalists and watchdogs have criticized. (See, for instance, recent coverage in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/23/climate/climate-disaster-relief-fema.html) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/17/disaster-survivors-fema-housing-trailer/).) 

The records could also clarify how well the system itself is working, another issue of potential concern. As a [2020 report by the Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-503.pdf) noted: 

> [...] program officials said this system—which is FEMA’s system of record for tracking direct temporary housing assistance—lacks controls; is inconsistently used by field staff; and has incomplete information, contributing to information-sharing challenges.

Even if inconsistencies and incompleteness ultimately prevent certain types of analysis, the public deserves to understand the specific nature of those problems.
