  title: Records Published
  body: >-
    On October 12, 2023, the Data Liberation Project [published the records received](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/unaccompanied-children-oversight-records) through this request, along with [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ch1_yS5bD5F7iyJakLFX7UAZMj0U9X1Dh4mNDMA9-UE/edit) and a note about the DLP's concerns about the records' completeness.

  title: Records Provided, DLP Processing
  body: >-
    On September 7, 2023, ACF completed its provision of the records requested (per the narrowed scope), in the form of a series of spreadsheets, each representing a table in the UC Portal. The Data Liberation Project is examining, documenting, and processing the records for public release.

  title: Scope of Request Narrowed
  body: >-
    Over a series of emails with ACF in early 2023, the Data Liberation Project agreed in mid-March to a narrowing of the scope of the request, focusing just on forms entered via the "UC Portal" since the portal's creation in 2014. This should include forms corresponding to [OMB 0970-0547](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202109-0970-014) (A-9, A-10A, A-10B, A-10C, and A-10D), but exclude forms corresponding to [OMB 0970-0564](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202112-0970-003) (M-1, M-3A, M-3B, M-5A, and M-5B). According to the agency, requesting the latter would "[add] a significant amount of work/burden for our entire team to pull/extract, as all these forms are not in the UC Portal or any other database, and are saved/located several places electronically, including [Office of Refugee Resettlement] resource email accounts."

  title: Estimated Date of Completion Provided
  body: >-
    On April 3, 2023, ACF provided an estimated completion date of April 26, 2023. â€œHowever, as stated in the acknowledgement letter sent to you on November 11, 2022, â€˜the actual processing time will depend on the complexity of your request and whether sensitive records, voluminous records, extensive search, and/or consultation with other HHS components or other executive branch agencies are involved.â€™â€œ

The [Office of Refugee Resettlement](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr) (ORR), part of the [Administration for Children & Families](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/) (ACF), is [officially responsible](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/uac-program-fact-sheet.pdf) for the care of every unaccompanied child, "defined as a child who has no lawful immigration status in the United States; has not attained 18 years of age; and, with respect to whom, there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or no parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and physical custody."
