*This request is a collaboration with journalist [Corin Faife](https://corinfaife.co/).*

If a Peace Corps volunteer chooses to resign from their position (as opposed to ending their service due to a medical condition or regional political situation), an assessment of the reason for this resignation is made by a supervising staff officer and collected via [Form MS-284 Attachment D](https://files.peacecorps.gov/documents/MS-284-Attachment-D.pdf) (‚ÄúResignation Form‚Äù). 

According to a [Federal Register notice](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/09/05/00-22559/privacy-act-of-1974-systems-of-records), information collected through this form is stored in the system of records known as ‚ÄúPeace Corps Volunteers: Reasons for Resignation, PEACE CORPS/PC-7,‚Äù or "PC-7" for short. 

[Our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23736388-2023-03-31-peace-corps-resignations-data-foia-request-faifesinger-vine) seeks all database records stored within the PC-7 system (as well as all analogous resignation form records stored in systems that may have preceded or succeeded PC-7), with the exception of data fields that contain personally-identifiable information.
