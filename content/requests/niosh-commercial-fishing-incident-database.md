The [Commercial Fishing Incident Database](https://web.archive.org/web/20220122120301/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/fishing/projects.html) (CFID) “is a surveillance system managed by [the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)] to collect information on fatalities and vessel disasters that occur in the US fishing industry.” The database “contains over 100 variables for each fatality” and [goes back](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/surveillance/pdfs/surveillance-briefing-document_8.6.19_508.pdf) at least to the year 2000.

The database enables the government to [ask questions](https://homeport.uscg.mil/Lists/Content/Attachments/938/NIOSH%202010%20high-risk.pdf) such as, “Where are the most hazardous fisheries?” “What are the worst problems?” “What causes fatalities in hazardous fisheries?” and “Where will prevention efforts be most effective?”

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23590155-2023-01-30-hhscdcniosh-commercial-fishing-incident-database-foia-request-singer-vine) seeks full copy of the database, minus fields containing personally-identifiable information. It also seeks all relevant database documentation.
