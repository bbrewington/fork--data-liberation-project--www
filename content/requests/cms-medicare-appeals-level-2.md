*This request is a collaboration with Mike Gartner of [Persius](https://github.com/TPAFS), an organization that provides free digital tools and data to help US consumers navigate issues with health insurance.*

Medicare uses a tiered appeals process by which beneficiaries can contest denials of coverage. The second level (‚ÄúLevel 2‚Äù) of the five level process is known as a [Qualified Independent Contractor (QIC) Reconsideration](https://www.medicare.gov/claims-appeals/file-an-appeal/appeals-level-2-qualified-independent-contractor-qic-reconsideration).

CMS currently maintains a [publicly accessible view](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/appeals-grievances/appeals-decision-search-part-c-d) of a structured dataset containing Level 2 appeal outcomes for [Medicare Parts C and Part D](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/get-started-with-medicare/medicare-basics/parts-of-medicare) (but neither Part A nor Part B). It contains the following fields:

- Medicare program part
- Appeal decision
- Decision date
- Appeal type
- Item/service
- Condition
- Case number
- Decision rationale
- Coverage rules

These fields, however, represent a small fraction of the records CMS collects for each Level 2 appeal through its [Medicare Appeals System](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cms-medicare-appeals-system.pdf). Furthermore, the online database contains only appeals decided since 2020.

For these reasons, [our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24522698-2024-03-28-cms-medicare-level-2-appeals-database-records-foia-request-gartnersinger-vine) seeks all database records representing Level 2 appeals for Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D, and their outcomes, minus personally-identifying information.
