  body: >-
    On November 27, 2024, co-requestors Mike Gartner and the Data Liberation Project filed a [letter appealing the partial and full denials](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25553789-cms-medicare-appeal/) of the request, arguing that responsive records exist and were improperly withheld.

  title: Partial Response Provided
  body: >-
    On October 16, 2024, [CMS responded to our request](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25553479-cms-medicare-appeals-partial-release-letter/), providing four spreadsheets. The fields provided were more limited than what is in the publicly maintained data available for 2020 onwards. At the same time, CMS rejected in full the request for Part A and Part B appeal outcomes.

*This request is a collaboration with Mike Gartner of [Persius](https://github.com/TPAFS), an organization that provides free digital tools and data to help US consumers navigate issues with health insurance.*

Medicare uses a tiered appeals process by which beneficiaries can contest denials of coverage. The second level (‚ÄúLevel 2‚Äù) of the five level process is known as a [Qualified Independent Contractor (QIC) Reconsideration](https://www.medicare.gov/claims-appeals/file-an-appeal/appeals-level-2-qualified-independent-contractor-qic-reconsideration).

CMS currently maintains a [publicly accessible view](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/appeals-grievances/appeals-decision-search-part-c-d) of a structured dataset containing Level 2 appeal outcomes for [Medicare Parts C and Part D](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/get-started-with-medicare/medicare-basics/parts-of-medicare) (but neither Part A nor Part B). It contains the following fields:

- Medicare program part
- Appeal decision
- Decision date
- Appeal type
- Item/service
- Condition
- Case number
- Decision rationale
- Coverage rules

These fields, however, represent a small fraction of the records CMS collects for each Level 2 appeal through its [Medicare Appeals System](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cms-medicare-appeals-system.pdf). Furthermore, the online database contains only appeals decided since 2020.

For these reasons, [our FOIA request üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24522698-2024-03-28-cms-medicare-level-2-appeals-database-records-foia-request-gartnersinger-vine) seeks all database records representing Level 2 appeals for Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D, and their outcomes, minus personally-identifying information.
