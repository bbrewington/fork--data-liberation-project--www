*This request is a collaboration with Mike Gartner of [Persius](https://github.com/TPAFS), an organization that provides free digital tools and data to help US consumers navigate issues with health insurance.*

In 2005, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the [Medicare Appeals System](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cms-medicare-appeals-system.pdf) (`MAS`) to track and store data on patientsâ€™ [appeals of Medicare insurance determinations](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/omha/files/medicare-appeals-backlog.pdf).

Despite the central role that `MAS` plays in the oversight and administration of Medicare appeals, little public documentation is available describing how it works or how it is structured.

[Our FOIA request ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24522699-2024-03-28-cms-mas-documentation-foia-request-gartnersinger-vine) seeks all records (such as user guides, data dictionaries, entity relationship diagrams, etc.) that document the functionality of the system.
