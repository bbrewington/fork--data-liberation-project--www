summary: Counts of resigned Peace Corps volunteers by post and resignation reasons.

---

If a Peace Corps volunteer chooses to resign from their position (as opposed to ending their service due to a medical condition or regional political situation), an assessment of the reason for this resignation is made by a supervising staff officer and collected via [Form MS-284 Attachment D](https://files.peacecorps.gov/documents/MS-284-Attachment-D.pdf) (“Resignation Form”). 

[Our FOIA request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/peace-corps-resignations/) sought all database records collected through that form. At first, the Peace Corps sent [a document with few details and all of the numbers redacted](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23870103-2023-05-02-resignation-reasons_redacted). The Data Liberation Project and co-requestor [Corin Faife](https://corinfaife.co/) successfully appealed that initial response; upon [granting the appeal](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24024460-2023-08-11-23-0186-appeal-response-letter), the agency provided a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h7Fj67isuuFUX5lW10IE6B6Cn1bvGtF9/edit#gid=1422850053) listing the number of resigned Peace Corps volunteers by post and resignation reasons through July 2023.

Each row in the spreadsheet indicates:

- The Peace Corps post — generally a single country but with some exceptions, such as “ALBANIA/MONTENEGRO” and “EASTERN CARIBBEAN”
- The primary reason listed for resignation (if any), from a set of possible categories — e.g., “Personal/Family,” “other career opportunity,” or “Peace Corps policies”
- The secondary reason listed (if any), from the same set of categories
- The number of volunteers corresponding to that post/primary-reason/secondary-reason through July 2023

⚠️  __Note__: The Peace Corps says it cannot vouch for the accuracy of the data.  Footnotes in the [initial document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23870103-2023-05-02-resignation-reasons_redacted) provided by the agency say: 

> • Data on resignation reason is best guess from Peace Corps overseas staff.
>
> • Data is not used for agency analysis, as it is deemed not trustworthy.
>
> • Data is collected through “Attachment D” – which is currently being removed from Volunteer exit interview.
>
> • Data collected from “Attachment D”(data that was requested) is currently in the process of being removed from database.
>
> • Any analysis done on this data is not an accurate reflection of Volunteer resignation reasons.

And the [appeal-granting letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24024460-2023-08-11-23-0186-appeal-response-letter) notes, “I reiterate that Peace Corps has not confirmed the accuracy of the data in the database as described in the Footnotes of the original document.”
