summary: Agency- and case-level data from “the first comprehensive, national reporting system for adult protective services programs.”

---

In February 2023, the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) filed [a request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/acl-adult-maltreatment-reporting-system/) to the Department of Health and Human Services’s [Administration for Community Living](http://acl.gov/node) (ACL), seeking a copy of all records in the agency’s  [National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System](https://acl.gov/programs/elder-justice/national-adult-maltreatment-reporting-system-namrs) (NAMRS), “the first comprehensive, national reporting system for adult protective services (APS) programs.”

The system “[consist\[s\] of three components](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/16/2023-03266/agency-information-collection-activities-proposed-collection-comment-request-national-adult)”:


> (1) Descriptive data on state agency and practices from all states through the “Agency Component,” and
> 
> (2) Case-level, non-identifiable data on persons who receive an investigation by APS in response to an allegation of abuse, neglect, or exploitation through “Case Component”, or
> 
> (3) For states that are unable to submit a case-level file through the “Case Component,” a “Key Indicators Component” will be available for them to submit data on a smaller set of core items.

On April 10, 2024, ACL provided a data transfer that completed its provision of records in response to this request, including substantial portions of all components described above.

To get started with the records, please consult the Data Liberation Project's [introductory documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzj-0DEpM2o5s37R7ixI2khjAbYDbT655EvnKWyvVkg/edit).
