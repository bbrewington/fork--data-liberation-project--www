summary: Amounts and dates of court-ordered relief and penalties in Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enforcement matters.

---

One of the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)’s key roles is to [investigate and enforce](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/life-cycle-of-enforcement-action/) potential violations of federal consumer finance laws. To track and organize those efforts, the CFPB uses an “enforcement matter management system” called ENForce. 

On May 30, 2023, the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org) filed a [FOIA request for detailed tables from that system](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/cfpb-enforcement-matters/). On September 18, 2023, the agency provided a [single spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QLJX90raianm8pE10dAKpVpGVoOPEIdc/edit) in response, listing the amounts and dates of court-ordered relief and penalties in those enforcement matters.

Although the Data Liberation Project plans to appeal the agency’s response, we are [providing the spreadsheet now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QLJX90raianm8pE10dAKpVpGVoOPEIdc/edit), along with [DLP-written documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bKkMicnyCpzXbE2SYbZ0gARK1DGSZcNrgWPWKHrPleY/edit), so that the public can make use of it.
