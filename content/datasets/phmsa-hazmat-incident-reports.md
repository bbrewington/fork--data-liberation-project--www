[Federal law](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-171/subpart-B/section-171.16)Â requires transportation-related spills, explosions, and other safety-endangering [incidents involving hazardous materials](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-171/subpart-B/section-171.15#p-171.15\(b\)) to be reported to the [Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/) (PHMSA).

Specifically, "each person in physical possession of a hazardous material at the time that any of [certain types of incidents] occurs during transportation (including loading, unloading, and temporary storage) must submit a Hazardous Materials Incident Report on DOT Form F 5800.1 [...] within 30 days of discovery of the incident".

These ["5800.1" forms](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/IncidentForm010105.pdf) include details about the location of the incident, mode of transportation, parties involved, hazardous materials involved, causes of failure, fatalities, injuries, financial cost, and more.

PHSMA publishes the submitted reports [through an online portal](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat-program-management-data-and-statistics/data-operations/incident-statistics). That portal, however, is brittle and does not provide a straightforward mechanism to download the full set of submitted reports.

The Data Liberation Project has fetched, and is updating daily, all reports available through that portal, and [making them available in bulk for further analysis](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/phmsa-hazmat-incident-reports).
