summary: Outcomes of investigations spurred by complaints submitted to the USDA's National Organic Program.

---

The US Department of Agriculture‚Äôs [National Organic Program](https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program) ‚Äúlaunched the COMPLIANCE Database in March 2019," according to [an agency report](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOPEnforcementUpdateMay2019.pdf). The tool allows the organization ‚Äúto better track case progress and more quickly identify patterns and relationships across complaints.‚Äù

In December 2023, we [filed a FOIA request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/usda-organic-program-enforcement/) seeking a comprehensive set of complaint, investigation, and outcome records from this database, as well as documentation concerning the database‚Äôs structure and interpretation. 

On March 12, 2024, the agency sent its [first interim response üìÑ](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24536945-2024-03-12-2024-ams-00070-f-first-interim-response-letter), providing a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gHNKxVObWfm1Q1JzkhDl8Wx4wKIPU-Wp/edit?usp=drive_link) that appears to list all *closed* investigations in the database. 

The spreadsheet contains 1,501 entries. Its twelve columns indicate the following information for each case:

- Case number 
- NOP case number 
- Subject/title
- Regulatory citations 
- Account/company name
- Complaint type ("Uncertified Operation" being the most common, followed by "Fraud", "Pesticide Residue", "Labeling Error", and several others)
- Complaint subtype 
- Inquiry received date/time
- Case opened date/time
- Case closed date/time
- Outcomes (e.g., "Compliance", "No Violation", "No Investigation", "Civil Penalty", etc.)
- Collected amount (for civil penalty outcomes)

"[The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service] will continue to process the remainder of your request and will forward any responsive records promptly upon completion of review," according to the agency's interim response letter.
