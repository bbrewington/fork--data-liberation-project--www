_This request is a collaboration with journalist [Alec Gitelman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-gitelman-2175902/)._

The Department of Defenseâ€™s Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program offers free and discounted equipment to foreign governments. Our FOIA request sought the latest version of the database, including any FOIA-disclosable data records not provided in the public spreadsheet.

The agency provided several PDFs containing and documenting its Excess Defense Articles transfer database from 1993 to 2023.

To get started with the data, please consult the Data Liberation Project's [introductory documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hytR0yvqEi-5AuCyx9CUuxLRNBB-plBjArJNerV_4SA/edit?usp=sharing).
