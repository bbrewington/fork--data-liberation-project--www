The FBI publishes aggregated data from its [National Instant Criminal Background Check System](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics). Unfortunately, the agency only posts those records as PDFs, rather than structured data files.

The Data Liberation Project runs a [open-source data pipeline](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/nics-firearm-background-checks) that downloads the most detailed of these PDFs — containing monthly counts of firearm background checks run by month, state, and firearm type — and extracts their data.

The project was created by Jeremy Singer-Vine (now Data Liberation Project founder) while at BuzzFeed News in 2015. In 2023, [BuzzFeed News shut down](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/). In April 2024, the Data Liberation Project forked the [original repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks) and resumed its operation.
