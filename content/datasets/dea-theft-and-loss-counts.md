The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) [requires](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr_reports/theft/index.html) all entities it has authorized to manufacture or handle [controlled substances](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/) and "[listed chemicals](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/chem_prog/34chems.htm)" to inform the agency about any "theft or significant loss of any controlled substance, disposal receptacles or listed chemicals within one business day of discovery of such loss or theft."

In September 2022, the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) (DLP) filed a [Freedom of Information Act request for database records corresponding to those reports](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/controlled-substance-theft-and-loss/) (excluding fields containing narratives or personal information), plus all relevant database documentation.

In May 2023, the DLP received the DEA's response. It contained a [determination letter ðŸ“„](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23813617-2023-05-12-signed-det-65) and two spreadsheets. The two spreadsheets contain aggregate *counts* of theft/loss incidents, aggregated by state, business activity, type of loss, and year. The agency did not provide any of the underlying report data requested, but later provided a [partially redacted manual](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25589722-dea-theftloss-of-controlled-substances-manual-partially-redacted/) for how to use the TLR program.
